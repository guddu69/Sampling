# Sampling
Analysing different Sampling techniques and testing them on different Machine Learning models. The dataset is Imbalanced so we use **SMOTE** to convert the Imbalanced dataset to balanced dataset by simply oversampling the miniority class.

*SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique*
